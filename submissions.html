                    <p>The Q4 round of PACM EICS reviewing will start in October and wrap up in early-mid December.  The due dates for the various phases of the process are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Submissions: October 18, 2017</li>
                        <li>Editorial Board bidding: October 20</li>
                        <li>Editorial Board assignments: October 23</li>
                        <li>Reviewer assignments: October 30</li>
                        <li>Reviews: November 20</li>
                        <li>Meta-Reviews and Discussion (Reviews sent out for rebuttal): November 27</li>
                        <li>Rebuttals from Authors: December 1</li>
                        <li>Reviewers Respond to Rebuttals &amp; Discussion: December 8</li>
                        <li>Editorial Board Meeting (virtual): December 11</li>
                        <li>Final Decisions: December 13, 2017</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Papers accepted during this iteration are not required to present at EICS 2018, though we hope they will choose to do so!<br />
                    Due to the quick turnaround from this quarter into the next one (expected submission due date for Q1 2018 is January 10), papers deemed acceptable after this round will move directly into the Sheridan camera-ready process.  Any papers deemed nearly acceptable but requiring checks by editorial board members before final acceptance will be required to resubmit to the next round.</p>

                    <h2>Future Iterations</h2>
                    <p>The structure of the EICS model is based on the normal conference review process, except iterated multiple times per year. This is contrast to a pure journal model, where submissions would be accepted at all times of the year and each paper has its own review process schedule.  This means that each iteration of the review process starts at a specific time, all papers (either being new submissions or revisions of previously submitted papers) submitted by the deadline are reviewed simultaneously, and decisions on all papers are made and announced at the same time. The benefit of this structured iteration is that reviewing effort can be planned for by editorial board members and reviewers in advance of submissions arriving, and the progress of papers through the process is easier to track because all papers have the same set of deadlines. This will also make sure the revision process is quick and predictable for authors.</p>
                    <p>The exact dates for future iterations are tentative. Final dates will be announced for the next iteration at or before the conclusion of the preceding iteration. Expected dates are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2017 Q4: October 18, 2017 (Decisions December 6)</li>
                        <li>2018 Q1: January 10, 2018 (Decisions February 28)</li>
                        <li>2018 Q2: March 28, 2018 (Decisions May 16)</li>
                        <li>2018 Q3: July 18, 2018 (Decisions September 5)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You will note that the iterations are not regularly spaced throughout the year, but arranged to fit within several constraints:</p>
                    <p>The Q3 deadline is chosen to follow the EICS conference by long enough for authors to make modifications based on discussions at the conference.  This time is also chosen so that rejection and major revisions papers have time to revise and submit to CHI (possibly to the Sub Committee on Engineering Interactive Systems and Technologies) should they decide to do so.</p>
                    <p>The Q4 deadline is set to allow authors that don’t quite succeed in getting their paper submitted to CHI to have a little extra time to tune their papers and to submit them to EICS PACM.  Decisions from our process would be out either just before or coincident with CHI decisions.</p>
                    <p>The Q1 and Q2 deadlines are set to allow two rounds of reviewing between the beginning of the year and the conference in late June.  This would allow a paper submitted at the normal conference time (early January) that receives a major revisions decision to be revised and still considered for the conference in the same year.</p>
                    <p>Note that there is no special process for the conference full papers separate from the PACM process. All full papers will be submitted via PACM. All other EICS conference venues, such as LBR papers, will have their own conference-specific processes.</p>

                    <h2>Submissions</h2>
                    <p>Submission to EICS PACM should present original and mature research work. High-quality, elaborated case studies and practice reports with generalizable findings will also be considered.</p>
                    <p>Papers should be written in the ACM small format (the linked page may say that PACMHCI uses the large format, but it is incorrect).</p>
                    <p>There are no length restrictions on papers, nor any limit to the number of references that may be included.</p>
                    <p>Papers should be anonymized. Primarily, this means that submissions must remove all author and institutional information from the title and header area of the first page of the paper. Author information should also be removed from submitted supplementary materials, in particular, videos. Submissions that do not do so may be rejected without review.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, all references must remain intact. If you previously published a paper and your current submission builds on that work, the complete reference with author's name must appear in the references. Authors must refer to their previous work in the third person (e.g., “We build on prior work by Smith et al. [X] but generalize their algorithm to new settings.”) and avoid blank references (e.g., “12. REMOVED FOR REVIEWING”). Further suppression of identity in the body of the paper (for example, in an Acknowledgements section), while encouraged, is left to the authors’ discretion.</p>
